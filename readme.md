# Custom MVC PHP Framework

This document provides an overview of a custom MVC (Model-View-Controller) PHP framework. It outlines the general structure and components typically found in such a framework to help you understand the project better.

## Overview of an MVC PHP Framework

### Model

- **Purpose**: Represents the data and the business logic of the application.
- **Components**: Database interactions, data validation, and business rules.
- **Example**: A `User` model that handles user data and interactions with the `users` table in the database.

### View

- **Purpose**: Represents the presentation layer of the application.
- **Components**: HTML templates, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Example**: A `user_profile.php` view that displays user information.

### Controller

- **Purpose**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
- **Components**: Handles user input, updates the model, and selects the appropriate view.
- **Example**: A `UserController` that processes user login requests and displays the user profile.


## Example Workflow

1. **User Request**: A user requests a URL, e.g., `http://example.com/user/profile`.
2. **Routing**: The framework routes this request to the `UserController` and calls the `profile` method.
3. **Controller Action**: The `profile` method in `UserController` interacts with the `User` model to fetch user data.
4. **Model Interaction**: The `User` model retrieves data from the database.
5. **View Rendering**: The controller passes the data to the `profile.php` view, which renders the HTML page.

## Conclusion

Understanding these components and their interactions will help you navigate and comprehend the custom MVC PHP framework once you have the actual code. If you have specific code or questions, feel free to share them for more detailed explanations.
